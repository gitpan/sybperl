       Sybperl 2.0, the Sybase OpenClient extensions for Perl 5
       --------------------------------------------------------

Finally, after six months of Beta, here it is: sybperl 2.0 for Perl 5.

This release includes the Sybase::DBlib and Sybase::Sybperl modules as
full production releases, and the Sybase::CTlib module which I still
keep in 'beta', as its development and testing is not quite over yet.

Improvements over previous 2b versions:

    - Improved documentation (probably still not perfect, though :-)
    - Improved build & installation instructions.
    - Static loading is much easier to implement (build & test)
    - Sybase::CTlib includes native handling of DATETIME, MONEY and
      NUMERIC/DECIMAL datatypes. This is done transparently, using
      operator overloading.

!!Behaviour change!!

   - The behaviour of the Sybase::DBlib::sql subroutine changed in
     2b3. In 2b2 (and before) saying @data = $d->sql(...) returned an
     array of rows, where each row is joined into a single line using
     a separator. In 2b3 (and later), @data is an array of references
     to rows, and each row is now an array, as returned by
     dbnextrow().
     
Do you need to upgrade?

   - If you have 2b3, and you are using the DBlib &/or Sybperl
     modules, then you do not *need* this new version (DBlib has not
     changed since 2b3).

   - If you are not ready to install Perl 5, then this version is
     (obviously) not for you.

   - If you are interested in the new Sybase::CTlib module, or if you
     had problems installing a previous version (in particular with
     regards to static loading) then I recommend that you get this new
     version.

As usual, comments, critics and bug reports are welcome :-)
