Wed Sep 20 17:43:15 1995  Michael Peppler  <mpeppler@kiruna>

	* Added UNDEF_BUG workaround for both DBlib.xs and CTlib.xs.

Mon Sep  4 12:16:48 1995  Michael Peppler  <mpeppler@kiruna>

	* DBlib/DBlib.xs (dbmsghandle): Change from void to SV * return
	type, so that we can return the previously defined handlers.

Tue Aug 15 11:10:51 1995  Michael Peppler  <mpeppler@kiruna>

	* DBlib/DBlib.pm (sql): Use wantarray to decide whether to return
	a ref to the results array or the array itself.

Wed Aug  9 14:17:00 1995  Michael Peppler  <mpeppler@kiruna>

	* DBlib/DBlib.xs (dbrpcparam): #ifdefs are required for differing
	versions of DBlibray (SYBNUMERIC, etc)

Mon Aug  7 13:59:16 1995  Michael Peppler  <mpeppler@kiruna>

	* Moved Sybperl/sybperl.pl to lib/sybperl.pl, and DBlib/sql.pl to
	lib/sql.pl . 

Mon Jul 31 12:50:06 1995  Michael Peppler  <mpeppler@kiruna>

	* DBlib/t/dblib.t: User id and password for test scripts is now
	looked up in a file (PWD, in the Sybase directory). I'm not sure
	that this is the best solution, though.

Sun May  7 10:55:30 1995  Michael Peppler  (mpeppler@troll)

	* DBlib/DBlib.pm: Added r_sql() routine, which returns references
	to data rows, as opposed to joining the columns of each data row
	with a separator.

	* README (Installation): Improved the docs a little bit.

Fri May  5 09:05:16 1995  Michael Peppler  (mpeppler@troll)

	* DBlib/DBlib.xs: Made sure DBSINGLE, DBDOUBLE, DBBOTH are defined
	when DBLIBVS < 420.
	(constant()): Returning NULL needed to be fixed when NULL is
	defined as (void *)0.

	* Makefile.PL: Added a postamble to avoid building
	Sybase.[c,o,so].

Fri Feb 10 12:32:00 1995  Michael Peppler  (mpeppler@troll)

	* DBlib/DBlib.pm: dbsucceed changed to return FAIL, SUCCEED or
	NO_MORE_RESULTS.

Thu Feb  9 14:01:03 1995  Michael Peppler  (mpeppler@troll)

	* DBlib/DBlib.xs (dbprtype): Was calling this function with the
	wrong arguments.
	(dbmnyminus/dbmny4minus): Both were called with the wrong number
	of arguments.

Wed Jan 11 10:22:32 1995  Michael Peppler  (mpeppler@troll)

	* DBlib/DBlib.xs (dberrhandle): Changed to accept all forms of
	Perl5 subroutine references: 'sub-name', \&sub-name, sub
	{...}. dbmsghandle changed similarily. With help from Paul
	Marquess.

Wed Nov 30 09:16:03 1994  Michael Peppler  (mpeppler@troll)

	* DBlib/DBlib.xs: Added explicit call to dbclose.

Fri Nov 25 15:35:32 1994  Michael Peppler  (mpeppler@troll)

	* Sybperl/Sybperl.pm: Added an Attribs package which takes care of
	setting the dbNullIsUndef, dbKeepNumeric and dbBin0x flags via a
	tie(). This is much cleaner than setting them each time in
	dbnextrow()!

Tue Nov 22 17:51:45 1994  Michael Peppler  (mpeppler@troll)

	* DBlib/DBlib.xs: Added dbprtype() call (Thanks to Alfred Nagl)

Mon Nov 14 09:50:26 1994  Michael Peppler  (mpeppler@troll)

	* DBlib/DBlib.xs (bcp_sendrow): Referencing colPtr[] was off by
	one.

Thu Oct 27 14:41:08 1994  Michael Peppler  (mpeppler@troll)

	* DBlib/DBlib.xs: Changed all the PUSH macros to XPUSH (for
	automatic stack management).

Mon Oct 24 11:45:08 1994  Michael Peppler  (mpeppler@troll)

	* DBlib/DBlib.xs (dbwritetext): Added dbwritetext(). All the
	DBlibrary API that sybperl 1.0xx implemented has now been
	implemented in version 2.

	* Makefile.PL (install): Added install target (portability not
	garanteed!)

Fri Oct 21 17:05:44 1994  Michael Peppler  (mpeppler@troll)

	* DBlib/DBlib.xs: Added 2PC calls.

Wed Oct 12 09:44:31 1994  Michael Peppler  (mpeppler@troll)

	* DBlib/DBlib.pm: Added 'sub new' as an alias for dblogin.

	* Sybase.xs: Added this file so that Configure finds us.

	* Makefile.PL (dynamic): Made sure a dynamic: and a static: target
	exists in the Makefile, otherwise the build fails when run from
	the main perl source directory.

Mon Oct 10 11:10:18 1994  Michael Peppler  (mpeppler@troll)

	* DBlib/DBlib.xs (dblogin): Added a 4th param (appname) which can
	be used to set the application name in sysprocesses. This
	parameter has also been added to dblogin (3rd param). Suggested by
	Eric Fifer.

	* Sybperl/Sybperl.pm: Added &sql(), and made a number of subs
	autoloaded. 

	* Reorganized the extension, so that we now have Sybase::DBlib,
	Sybase::CTlib (planned) and Sybase::Sybperl.

Thu Sep 22 14:45:24 1994  Michael Peppler  (mpeppler@troll)

	* lib/Sybperl.pm: Moved the definition of the backward compatible
	variables from sybperl.pl to here.
	Added all the DBMONEY calls.

	* SybaseDB.xs (initialize): Added $SybperlVer definition.
	Added all the DBMONEY routines from version 1.0xx.

Mon Sep 19 08:14:33 1994  Michael Peppler  (mpeppler@troll)

	* lib/Sybperl.pm: Changed so that it's enough to say 'Use Sybperl'
	to use this interface to SybaseDB.

	* SybaseDB.xs (dbhasretstat): Typo... no 's' at the end!

Fri Sep 16 08:55:00 1994  Michael Peppler  (mpeppler@troll)

	* SybaseDB.xs: Added most of the rest of the calls available in
	sybperl1.x except DBMONEY calls.
	Added a BOOT: section.

	* SybaseDB.pm: Got rid of the Attributes sub-class, which is
	replaced by having SybaseDB::dblogin return a hash instead.

Thu Sep 15 10:08:49 1994  Michael Peppler  (mpeppler@troll)

	* lib/sybutil.pl: New file. Used to hold the default perl error
	and message handlers, and can be used to customize the environment.

	* t/sybperl.t: Added this test script.

	* lib/Sybperl.pm: Added &dbuse().

	* SybaseDB.xs: Added dbexit(). Added bcp_*() calls.
