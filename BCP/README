README for Sybase::BCP.

This module is intended to be used on top of the Sybase::DBlib module
of sybperl 2.04 or later.

**WARNING**

This is an ALPHA level release. Please use with care!

INSTALLATION:

If you are installing sybperl 2.04 or later, then this module will get
automatically installed.

If you are installing a new version of Sybase::BCP on top of an
existing Sybase::DBlib module, then simply type

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make install

in this directory.

There are no regression tests defined for this module yet.

The date conversion routines have not been well tested.

Documentation is embedded in the BCP.pm file. Extract with pod2man or
pod2html, for example.

As always, comments are welcome, either to myself <mpeppler@itf.ch> or
to the sybperl mailing list <sybperl-l@trln.lib.unc.edu>
