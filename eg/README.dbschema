I had started rewriting dbschema to work with the new System 10
features, but that was several months ago, and I don't currently have
a System 10 server running here.
This version of dbschema probably works on a 4.9.2 server, but there
may be problems against a 10.x server (the new
numeric/identity/decimal datatypes and the referential integrity
constraints, among others).

The previous version of dbschema is available in dbschema.old
