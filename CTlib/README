	@(#)README	1.1	8/7/95
	
This is an ALPHA version of the CTlib module. It is based on the API
definition that has been developped by Dave Bowen & Amy Lin at
Sybase.

It is a fairly small subset of the CTlibrary API, and documentation
has been included in pod/sybperl.pod.

***WARNING***

There is a chance that the API definition will still change in the
future. Although I think that this will mean *additional* calls, rather
than *modified* calls, you should still be aware of this possibility.


Of course, comments are welcome!
