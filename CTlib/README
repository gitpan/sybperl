	@(#)README	1.2	10/18/95
	
This is a Beta version of the CTlib module. It is based on the API
definition that has been developped by Dave Bowen & Amy Lin at
Sybase, but includes some quite usefull additions (in particular, the
native handling of datetime and money values).

There is a chance that the API definition will still change in the
future. Although I think that this will mean *additional* calls, rather
than *modified* calls, you should still be aware of this possibility.


Of course, comments are welcome!
