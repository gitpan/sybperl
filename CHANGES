	@(#)CHANGES	1.3	1/5/96

2.01	For use with either Perl 5.001m or Perl 5.002.

	New Features:

	CTlib DateTime, Money and Numeric data handling is now done
	either in native mode (ie the data is converted to char
	strings or floating precision only when needed which is
	sometimes slow) or in 'convert' mode (all data is retrieved in
	string or floating point format). The default is to retrieve
	data in 'convert' mode. See the 'Attributes' sub-section in
	the CTlib section of the manual (pod/sybperl.pod)

	Bug Fixes

	BugId	   Description

	140	   CTlib uses excessive amounts of memory.

	The Makefile.PLs have been updated so that they work both with
	5.001m (the version I recommend for production use at this
	point) and 5.002 beta.
	
2.0b	Updated to work with Perl 5.002 beta. This version *requires*
	Perl 5.002beta1f, and MakeMaker.pm 5.14.

	Bug fixes:

	BugId	    Description

	132	    Bizarre copy of CODE in subroutine entry at
		    t/dblib.t line 93.
	138	    Problems installing sybperl after upgrading to
		    5.002 beta 1f.

	In addition, the 'undef' bug that I uncovered in sybperl 2b3
	has been fixed, so the -DUNDEF_BUG is not necessary anymore.

	The MakeMaker utility has progressed, making the existence of
	the infamous empty Sybase.xs file unnecessary.

2.0a	Bug fixes:

	BugId	    Description

	130	    CTlib/t/ctlib.t test fails on AIX
	136	    CTlib fails test on an Onyx running Irix
	137	    dbnextrow core dumps when retrieve row with binary
		    length > 140
	135	    Behaviour change of DBlib::sql not documented in README
	133	    MakeMaker 5.03 doesn't work with Sybperl.

	Additional functionality:

	DBlib::DBDEAD and DBlib::remove_xact have been added (thanks
	to Joel Truher).

2.0	Base release.
