	@(#)CHANGES	1.5	1/31/96

2.03	Bug fixes to Sybase::DBlib.

	Retrieving large numeric/decimal/identity values caused
	floating point values in exponential notation to be
	returned. This was due to the default behaviour of DBlibrary
	to be compatible with release 4.6.1. This version
	AUTOMATICALLY calls dbsetversion() to enable System 10
	handling of numeric/decimal/identity data if you build against
	a System 10 version of DBlibrary.

	Logging for dbwritetext() has been enabled by adding an
	additional (optional) $log parameter. I'm not very happy with
	the calling sequence (it's getting further and further from
	the C version), but that's the cost of not doing it right from
	the start, I guess...

	BugId	   Description

	155	   Retrieving large integers (of numeric or decimal
		   data types) creates floating point data in
		   exponential notation.
	156	   dbsetversion() does not work.
	123	   Allow logging for dbwritetext().
	

2.02    Updates & Improvements to the CTlib and DBlib modules.

	New Features:

	Sybase::CTlib::ct_sql() can now return an array of references
	to associative arrays (one for each row).
	Sybase::CTlib::ct_fetchable() uses a precomputed hash to check
	the fetchable status (suggested by Gisle Aas).
	Added Sybase::CTlib::ct_cmd_alloc to allow multiple CS_COMMAND
	structures with a single connection.
	Added Sybase::CTlib::ct_cmd_realloc to drop and realloc the
	current CS_COMMAND structure.

	Added Sybase::DBlib::db*opt() calls. The dbsetopt() call was
	implemented in version 1.0xx but somehow did not get recoded
	in 2.x.
	Sybase::DBlib::sql() can now return an array of references to
	associative arrays (one for each row).

	Bug Fixes:

	BugId	   Description

	146	   Need multiple CS_COMMAND structures for ct_cursor
		   operations.
	147	   $date->calc() changes both the original $date and
		   the new date.
	148	   Sybperl.pm does not export $DB_IN, $DB_OUT.
	151	   Sybperl.pm does not define &dbwritetext().
	152	   Sybperl.pm defines $main::ComputeID, sybperl 1.0xx
		   used $main::ComputeId.


2.01	For use with either Perl 5.001m or Perl 5.002.

	New Features:

	CTlib DateTime, Money and Numeric data handling is now done
	either in native mode (ie the data is converted to char
	strings or floating precision only when needed which is
	sometimes slow) or in 'convert' mode (all data is retrieved in
	string or floating point format). The default is to retrieve
	data in 'convert' mode. See the 'Attributes' sub-section in
	the CTlib section of the manual (pod/sybperl.pod)

	Bug Fixes

	BugId	   Description

	140	   CTlib uses excessive amounts of memory.

	The Makefile.PLs have been updated so that they work both with
	5.001m (the version I recommend for production use at this
	point) and 5.002 beta.
	
2.0b	Updated to work with Perl 5.002 beta. This version *requires*
	Perl 5.002beta1f, and MakeMaker.pm 5.14.

	Bug fixes:

	BugId	    Description

	132	    Bizarre copy of CODE in subroutine entry at
		    t/dblib.t line 93.
	138	    Problems installing sybperl after upgrading to
		    5.002 beta 1f.

	In addition, the 'undef' bug that I uncovered in sybperl 2b3
	has been fixed, so the -DUNDEF_BUG is not necessary anymore.

	The MakeMaker utility has progressed, making the existence of
	the infamous empty Sybase.xs file unnecessary.

2.0a	Bug fixes:

	BugId	    Description

	130	    CTlib/t/ctlib.t test fails on AIX
	136	    CTlib fails test on an Onyx running Irix
	137	    dbnextrow core dumps when retrieve row with binary
		    length > 140
	135	    Behaviour change of DBlib::sql not documented in README
	133	    MakeMaker 5.03 doesn't work with Sybperl.

	Additional functionality:

	DBlib::DBDEAD and DBlib::remove_xact have been added (thanks
	to Joel Truher).

2.0	Base release.
