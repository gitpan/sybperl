	@(#)CHANGES	1.14	12/30/97

2.09	Performance Enhancements / Win32 portability release:

	Added nsql() routine to Sybase::DBlib (contributed by 
	W. Phillip Moore).

	Added dbcc.pl (run dbcc's and filter the error messages) and 
	SecureSql.pm (contributed by Olivier Mary) to the eg/
	directory.

	Bug fixes:

	216 Sybase::BCP fails under Win32 systems
	219 Silence some 'variable used only once' warnings.

2.08_52

	Added dbsetdefcharset() and dbsetdeflang() to Sybase::DBlib
	Added cs_dt_info() to Sybase::CTlib.
	Added ability to set certain connection properties in
	Sybase::CTlib.

	Bug Fixes:

	209: CTlib appends trailing \0 byte to string values.

2.08_51
	Added dbproc and ConInfo attributes back into the handle
	attributes.
	Fixed some small-ish bugs introduced by the changes in
	2.08_50.
	Merged in porting notes to Win32 from Krzysztof Koczyjan
	<krzysztofK@worldnet.att.net> (see README.win32 for details).

	Bug Fixes:

	194: CTlib has hard coded warn() calls in ct_connect()

2.08_50
	Avoids hash for storage of internal attributes data.
	Can return reference to a pre-allocated array.

	Bug Fixes

	Merged in porting notes for VMS from Charles Bailey 
	(baily@newman.upenn.edu)

2.08	New Features:

	Added dbpreptext(), dbreadtext(), dbmoretext(), dbsqlok()
	and force_dbclose() to Sybase::DBlib.
	Added dbspid() to Sybase::DBlib

	Bug Fixes

	Made some code adjustments to silence some perl 5.004
	warnings.
	Finally fixed the "'rpcInfo' is not a valid Sybase::DBlib
	attribute" bug...
	Fixed DBSETLPACKET() macro definition (for pre-system 10
	libraries).
	Fixed ct_config() so that integer values can be set and
	retrived. This implied adding a 'type' argument which defaults
	to CS_CHAR_TYPE, but must be set to CS_INT_TYPE if integer
	values are passed or retrieved.
	Fixed dbclose() in Sybperl.pm to *really* close connections.
	Renamed config to config.pl to avoid problems under Win/NT.
	ct_fetch() added an extra \0 at the end of TEXT/IMAGE data.
	Fixed a reorder bug in BCP.pm.
	Fixed Sybase::CTlib::ct_sql() to set $dbh->{RC} to CS_FAIL 
	when an error occurs in the processing.
	Sybase::DBlib::dbrpcxxx() calls where not returning any success
	or failure information.
	Sybase::CTlib::ct_col_types() returns CS_INT_TYPE for all integer
	types.

2.07	Bug Fixes

	Added ct_config() call to CTlib.
	Fixed memory leak when using TEXT data with the CTlib module.
	Fixed some data handling and column splitting problems in the
	BCP module.
	Improved data handling and data integrity in the bcp_*() calls
	in DBlib.

2.06	Bug Fixes

	Fixed memory leak when the -DDO_TIE compile time option is
	turned on.
	Fixed 32/64 bit pointer problem that caused CTlib to fail on
	the Dec Alpha.
	DESTROY function now makes sure that it only closes
	connections in the process that created them (ie a child
	process started via fork() would sometimes close the
	connections of the parent...)
	New, fully re-written dbschema.pl (thanks to David Whitmarsh)

2.05	Bug Fixes

	BugId	   Description

	165	   Make fails if DBLIBVS < 461.
	166	   bcp_sendrow() truncates binary (ie TEXT/IMAGE)
		   fields if they contain NULL bytes.
	167	   The 5.002 make install places local module in
		   $PERL5LIB/site_perl, which is searched *after*
		   $PERL5LIB.
	169	   -L$SYBASE/lib comes too late in the
		   $LDFLAGS/$LDDLFLAGS Makefile variables, which can
		   cause the wrong library to be referenced (tcl/tk's
		   libtcl.a vs. Sybase's).
	170	   Retrieving numeric data causes the fields to be
		   padded with spaces instead of being NULL terminated
		   after the last digit.


2.04	DBlib and CTlib Feature release.
        New Sybase::BCP module.

	** NOTE **

	This version requires Perl 5.002.

	- Added ct_describe to retrieve the information held in the
	  CS_DATAFMT structure for each column in the result set.
	- Added Sybase::{CTlib, DBlib}::debug(level) which enables the
	  tracing of certain internal states and operations.
	- Turned Sybase::CTlib and Sybase::DBlib database handle
	  attributes into a tied hash, so that invalid attribute names
	  (such as spelling mistakes) can be caught (NOTE: This is a
	  compile time option that can be turned OFF if you don't like
	  it). To allow add hoc attributes to be set by the programer
	  you can pass a hash reference as fifth parameter to the
	  dblogin/ct_connect calls with the additional attributes that
	  you want the DBlib or CTlib modules to recognize.
	- Added Sybase::DBlib::DBSETLPACKET and
	  Sybase::DBlib::dbgetpacket to allow the use of non-default
	  network packet sizes (this can increase the performance
	  tremendously in certain situations).
	- Sybase::DBlib can now return DATETIME and MONEY values in native
	  format, with the same functionality as Sybase::CTlib.
	- Re-wrote and cleaned up some of the logic in
	  Sybase::DBlib::dbnextrow() and dbretdata().
	- bcp_sendrow() can now take an array reference as data
	  parameter instead of a LIST. This is a small performance
	  improvement when processing wide tables. (Passing a LIST is
	  still supported).
	  
	- Added some additional regression tests.

	- Reviewed the documentation.

	- Sybase::BCP is a new module that attempts to make it easier
	  to use the bulk copy library. Sybase::BCP includes many
	  features such as input column re-ordering, failed batch
	  retries and date/time conversions. It is sub-classed from
	  the Sybase::DBlib module.

	- Sybase::Login is a tkPerl login widget for sybperl. It
	  requires the Tk module. You will find it in
	  eg/Login.pm. Contributed by Brent B. Powers.

	Bug Fixes:
	
	BugId	   Description

	158	   Sybase::CTlib dumps core when retrieving "Extended
		   Error" data in the default Server Message handler.
	159	   Make DBSETLPACKET() available in DBlib.
	161	   make test fails for Sybase::DBlib, Sybase::Sybperl
		   with perl5.002gamma.
	163	   bcp_batch is not documented.
			   
	
2.03	Bug fixes to Sybase::DBlib.

	- Retrieving large numeric/decimal/identity values caused
	  floating point values in exponential notation to be
	  returned. This was due to the default behaviour of DBlibrary
	  to be compatible with release 4.6.1. This version
	  AUTOMATICALLY calls dbsetversion() to enable System 10
	  handling of numeric/decimal/identity data if you build against
	  a System 10 version of DBlibrary.
	- Logging for dbwritetext() has been enabled by adding an
	  additional (optional) $log parameter. I'm not very happy with
	  the calling sequence (it's getting further and further from
	  the C version), but that's the cost of not doing it right from
	  the start, I guess...

	BugId	   Description

	155	   Retrieving large integers (of numeric or decimal
		   data types) creates floating point data in
		   exponential notation.
	156	   dbsetversion() does not work.
	123	   Allow logging for dbwritetext().
	

2.02    Updates & Improvements to the CTlib and DBlib modules.

	New Features:

	- Sybase::CTlib::ct_sql() can now return an array of references
	  to associative arrays (one for each row).
	- Sybase::CTlib::ct_fetchable() uses a precomputed hash to check
	  the fetchable status (suggested by Gisle Aas).
	  Added Sybase::CTlib::ct_cmd_alloc to allow multiple CS_COMMAND
	  structures with a single connection.
	- Added Sybase::CTlib::ct_cmd_realloc to drop and realloc the
	  current CS_COMMAND structure.

	- Added Sybase::DBlib::db*opt() calls. The dbsetopt() call was
	  implemented in version 1.0xx but somehow did not get recoded
	  in 2.x.
	- Sybase::DBlib::sql() can now return an array of references to
	  associative arrays (one for each row).

	Bug Fixes:

	BugId	   Description

	146	   Need multiple CS_COMMAND structures for ct_cursor
		   operations.
	147	   $date->calc() changes both the original $date and
		   the new date.
	148	   Sybperl.pm does not export $DB_IN, $DB_OUT.
	151	   Sybperl.pm does not define &dbwritetext().
	152	   Sybperl.pm defines $main::ComputeID, sybperl 1.0xx
		   used $main::ComputeId.


2.01	For use with either Perl 5.001m or Perl 5.002.

	New Features:

	- CTlib DateTime, Money and Numeric data handling is now done
	  either in native mode (ie the data is converted to char
	  strings or floating precision only when needed which is
	  sometimes slow) or in 'convert' mode (all data is retrieved in
	  string or floating point format). The default is to retrieve
	  data in 'convert' mode. See the 'Attributes' sub-section in
	  the CTlib section of the manual (pod/sybperl.pod)

	Bug Fixes

	BugId	   Description

	140	   CTlib uses excessive amounts of memory.

	The Makefile.PLs have been updated so that they work both with
	5.001m (the version I recommend for production use at this
	point) and 5.002 beta.
	
2.0b	Updated to work with Perl 5.002 beta. This version *requires*
	Perl 5.002beta1f, and MakeMaker.pm 5.14.

	Bug fixes:

	BugId	    Description

	132	    Bizarre copy of CODE in subroutine entry at
		    t/dblib.t line 93.
	138	    Problems installing sybperl after upgrading to
		    5.002 beta 1f.

	In addition, the 'undef' bug that I uncovered in sybperl 2b3
	has been fixed, so the -DUNDEF_BUG is not necessary anymore.

	The MakeMaker utility has progressed, making the existence of
	the infamous empty Sybase.xs file unnecessary.

2.0a	Bug fixes:

	BugId	    Description

	130	    CTlib/t/ctlib.t test fails on AIX
	136	    CTlib fails test on an Onyx running Irix
	137	    dbnextrow core dumps when retrieve row with binary
		    length > 140
	135	    Behaviour change of DBlib::sql not documented in README
	133	    MakeMaker 5.03 doesn't work with Sybperl.

	Additional functionality:

	DBlib::DBDEAD and DBlib::remove_xact have been added (thanks
	to Joel Truher).

2.0	Base release.
