# CTlib version. Set to 0 if Client Library is not available on your
# system, or if you don't want to build the CTlib module. The Client
# Library started shipping with System 10.
# Note that the CTlib module is still under construction, though the

# Additional libraries.
# Some systems require -lnsl or -lBSD.
# Solaris 2.x needs -ltli
# DEC OSF/1 needs -ldnet_stub and may need -lsdna
#   (Note: Under Dec 3.2 you need to *remove* -lsdna from the DBlib/Makefile
#    for things to work. *sigh*)
# SunOS 4.x needs -linsck
# HP-UX 10.x needs -linsck
# AIX 3.2.5 needs -linsck
# Linux needs -linsck
# See the Sybase OpenClient Supplement for your OS/Hardware
# combination.

# Library directory. Under Windows/NT, if you are using the Borland
# compilers, then uncomment the line below:
# BORLAND_LIBS=blib

# Additional #defines.
# With Perl 5.001m, you will need -DUNDEF_BUG.
# With Perl 5.002, none are normally needed, but you may wish to
# use -DDO_TIE to get the benefit of stricter checking on the
# Sybase::DBlib and Sybase::CTlib attributes.

EXTRA_DEFS=-DDO_TIE


# LINKTYPE
# If you wish to link Sybase::DBlib and/or Sybase::CTlib statically
# into perl uncomment the line below and run the make normally. Then,
# when you run 'make test' a new perl binary will be built.
#LINKTYPE=static
